# [Beginner JavaScript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) Learning Club

## Learning Goal:

- For beginners: Go from absolute beginners to "I can get some stuff done but don't feel totally comfortable"
- For experienced devs: Fill in the holes in our skill set and refresh our existing JavaScript knowledge and pick up some new tips & tricks along the way

## Learning Curriculum:

### Wes Bos' Beginner JavaScript course

- [Beginner JavaScript Notes + Reference **(FREE)**](https://wesbos.com/javascript)
- [**OPTIONAL:** Beginner JavaScript video course **(PAID)**](https://beginnerjavascript.com/)

## Schedule

Inspired by [Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 challenge](https://javascript30.com/), I structured this schedule as a 1 month challenge to complete the Beginner JavaScript course. I divvied up the course content into 30 days, with each day having around 1 hour (based on the video lecture lengths) of learning material.

The challenge officially starts **Monday, June 20, 2022**. Check out the Tech Career Shifter PH Discord Server where we'll open discussion threads for each day of the challenge.
