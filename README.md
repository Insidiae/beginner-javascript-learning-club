# [Beginner JavaScript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) Learning Club

As part of the study group initiative for Tech Career Shifters PH, I'm hosting a learning club for Wes Bos's [Beginner JavaScript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) course. The agenda for this learning club is a [30-day challenge format](schedule.md) where we go through the course in up to 1 hour chunks per day.

In this repository you will find my own progress as we go along the 30-day challenge.
