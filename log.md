### Day 1: June 20, 2022

**What we learned:**

- Basic project setup
- Different ways to run JavaScript
- Writing basic JavaScript syntax
- Enforcing code quality via ESLint and Prettier

**My Notes:** For the first day of this challenge, we went through some basic setup for the course starter files, and making sure we have installed the various programs and tools we will be using throughout the course.

Next, we explored different ways to run JavaScript:

- We can run JS directly via the browser console (Chrome shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+J`)
- We can add a `<script>` tag in our HTML file and directly run JS from there. Here we also learn why we have to place our `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag, to ensure that the elements in our HTML code have already loaded before our JS code runs.
- We can add a separate `.js` file, reference it via `<script src="filename.js">`, and run the code contained in that `.js` file.
- We can use Node.js to run our `.js` files. This is typically done for server-side JS code.

Next, we learned how to write some basic JS statements, and learned three different ways to define JS variables:

- Variables defined with `var` can be changed later, and is _function-scoped_ (only available within the parent function)
- Variables defined with `let` can be changed, but is also _block-scoped_ (a bit more strictly scoped than `var`, we'll explore this later in the course!)
- Variables defined with `const` cannot be changed (except for arrays and/or objects, again we'll learn more about those later in the course!)

Finally, we are introduced to two of the most popular tools for enforcing code quality and formatting in out JS code, which are ESLint and Prettier. ESLint is a _linter_, or a tool that helps us identify or report potential issues in our JS code. ESLint is also configurable (lets us set different "rules" depending on our preferred coding style) and pluggable (lets us use predefined "rules" that other people have already spent time choosing well). Prettier enforces _formatting_ for our JS code, such as indentation, spaces between lines of code, or even adding/removing semicolons and enforcing consistency between single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

### Day 2: June 21, 2022

**What we learned:**

- Basic JavaScript Types
  - Strings
  - Numbers
  - Objects
  - Null/Undefined
  - Booleans
- JavaScript Function basics
  - Built-in vs Custom functions

**My Notes:**
Today we learn about the basic data types that are included in JS:

- **Strings**: Used for holding text, denoted by single (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Also has a special variant called _template strings_, denoted by backticks (`` ` ``) which can be used for more complex stuff such as interpolation and adding multiple lines.
- **Numbers**: Pretty much self explanatory ðŸ˜… JS supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), as well as having a built-in `Math` helper methods that are useful for various everyday things such as rounding or generating random numbers.
- **Objects**: The biggest building block in JS. Almost everything in JS can be considered an object. Objects are a way to group related data into a single variable through a `{ key: value }` pair. The course will also have a section later dedicated to exploring objects in-depth!
- **Undefined**: A way to express "nothing" in JS. If you create a variable (or object property) and don't set anything to it, it will be `undefined`.
- **Null**: Another way to express "nothing" in JS. `null` is something that has been given an _explicit_ value of nothing, whereas `undefined` can be something that has _not yet_ been given a value.
- **Booleans**: Can either be `true` or `false`. We'll be using booleans a lot throughout the course to add logic in our JS code.

We also learn how JS handles equality. There are two ways to check equality in JS:

- Using **double equal signs** (`==`), JS performs what is called a _type coercion_, which attempts to put the two values into the same type before checking equality. This is where you might get funky stuff like `"10" == 10` returning `true`.
- Using **triple equal signs** (`===`), JS checks both value _and_ type for equality. More often than not, we'll want to work with the same data type when checking for equality (i.e. `"10" === 10` should return `false`). This is why **we should almost always be using `===`** when checking for equality in JS.

Finally, we also learn the basics of functions in JS. For today, we only take a look into using buit-in JS functions (such as those `Math` helper methods) as well as how to create our own functions in JS. We'll take a much deeper dive on functions in the upcoming lectures!

### Day 3: June 22, 2022

**What we learned:**

- More about Functions
  - Parameters and Arguments
  - Different ways to declare functions

**My Notes:** In today's lectures, we take a deeper dive on JS functions. Here's a quick recap on today's topics:

- **Anatomy of a JS Function**: Wes put together a neat cheatsheet that explains the different parts of a function. Check it out:
  ![Wes Bos's Function Definition Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesbos/beginner-javascript/master/function-definition.jpg)
- **Parameters/Arguments**: Can be passed into a function, which are then used like variables available within the function's scope. Parameters are the _placeholders_ (or the variable names) for the values to be passed to the function, while arguments are the _actual values_ passed to the function.
- **Default Parameter Values**: Parameters can have default values assigned to them upon defining the function. This allows us to call the function without passing in any value to those parameters, as they will just fall back to using these default values when you don't explicitly pass them.
- **Different ways to declare functions**:
  - **Function Declaration**: The classic way to declare functions: (`function f() { /* ... */ }`)
  - **Anonymous Function**: Functions without a name. Errors out on their own. Typically used as a quick way to pass functions into something else, such as callbacks: (`function() { /* ... */ }`)
  - **Function Expression**: Stores the function as a value in a variable: (`const f = function() { /* ... */ }`)
  - **Arrow Function**: A newer, more concise way to write functions: (`const f = () => { /* ... */ }`)
- **Hoisting**: Basically the ability to call functions before they are actually declared. Only applies to regular function declarations - functions stored within variables (like function expressions) are NOT hoisted.
- **IIFE**: Stands for **Immediately Invoked Function Expression**. IIFEs are functions that are immediately run upon declaration. Used to be a very popular way to call one-off functions in the old days of JS before it had modules and block scope.
- **Methods**: Functions that live inside objects.
- **`this`**: A reference to the object that it was called against. Especially useful when dealing with methods, and are basically the reason why you might or might not want to use arrow functions when declaring these methods.
- **Callback Functions**: Functions that are called after something is done, such as handling user clicks or time based events such as `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.

### Day 4: June 23, 2022

**What we learned:** Debugging tools, Scope, Hoisting, and Closures

**My Notes:**

**Debugging Tools**
We explore different ways to debug our JS apps. The most common way to debug JS apps is through `console.log()` (and its other flavors such as `info`/`warn`/`error`). Logging to the console also provides us a _stack trace_, where we can see the function call/s that triggered the `console.log()` and help identify where to look for bugs. We may also make use of breakpoints (via the `debugger` command or manually setting breakpoints via the devtools), where we can then run our code line-by-line to take a closer look on how our code runs. We can also look at the `Network` tab to see the network requests our code may be making, letting us know how long those network requests take and examine the data getting passed around on each request.

**Scope**
Today we explore the different kinds of scope we encounter in JS:

- **Global Variables:** Exactly what it says on the tin. They are globally available, meaning they can be accessed anywhere within your application. In browser contexts, global variables are also attached to the `window` object, letting us reference them via `window.globalVariableName`.
- **Function Scope:** Variables defined within a function are only available within the bounds of that function (and any other functions defined within that function, as we'll see when we explore closures later). If there are other variables with the same name defined in an upper scope (i.e. global variables), the variable defined within the function takes priority (This behavior is called _variable shadowing_, which you might see an ESLint error about when coding along with the lectures)
- **Block Scope:** A unique behavior for variables defined using `let` or `const`. As the name implies, Block scoped variables are only accessible within the block they are defined in (usually between curly braces `{ }`). This is useful for preventing variables from unnecessarily leaking outside their containing blocks and potentially causing conflicts with other parts of the code.
- **Lexical/Static Scope:** Describes the way JS looks up variable definitions. JS will look up variables starting from where the function is _defined_, rather than where the function is _actually being ran_.

**Hoisting**
We already somewhat covered this yesterday. Today, we just explore more practical examples where hoisting can be useful.

**Closures**
Wes sums up closures quite nicely:

> Closures are the ability of a child (or inner) function to access variables from a higher level scope (i.e. from an outer function) even after the outer functions have been called or closed or closed over.

### Day 5: June 24, 2022

**What we learned:** Basics of working with the DOM

**My Notes:** Today we start to build tangible examples within the browser using JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM). Using the DOM, we can select existing elements within the webpage using `document.querySelector()` to select a single element, or `querySelectorAll()` to get a list of all elements that match a corresponding CSS selector string passed to the method. There are also other methods to more explicitly select elements such as `getElementById()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, `getElementsByTagName()`, etc.

With the ability to select elements, we can now also start manipulating the properties of that element and/or work with its built-in methods and see the results in the webpage. For example, here's how we can work with the text contained within the selected element:

- `innerText`/`textContent`: Both can get (or set) the text contained within the selected element. The only difference is that `innerText` returns only the human readable content whereas `textContent` will get the contents of all of its child elements, including hidden elements and `<script>`/`<style>` elements.
- `innerHTML`: Gets (or sets) the HTML content of the selected element, turning it into (or parsing it from) a string.
- `insertAdjacentText()`: If you only want to append text content at the beginning or end of the selected element, this is a much easier way to do so (instead of using something like template strings).

We can also work with CSS classes with an element's `classList` object. an element's `classList` object has useful methods to `add()` or `remove()` classes, or even `toggle()` classes on or off. You can also easily check if the element `contains()` a specific class!

We can also work with other attributes for certain elements like `width`, `height`, or element-specific attributes like an `<img>` element's `alt` attribute. Elements have the `getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()`, and `hasAttribute()` methods which we can use to work with these attributes.

While we can add our own custom attributes using the `setAttribute` method, this is a somewhat discourage practice because it is possible to for it to have conflicts when future HTML standards change. Instead, we can use an element's special `dataset` object where we can add our own custom attributes. The `dataset` object then takes these custom attributes and appends them with `data-`, e.g. `dataset.description` turns into `data-description` when you go and inspect the element.

### Day 6: June 25, 2022

**What we learned:** Different ways to create and manage DOM elements, and navigating through the DOM

**My Notes:** We can create new DOM elements using the `document.createElement()` method. Though the newly-created DOM elements don't yet appear in the actual page, we can still modify their contents/attributes/etc. with the various methods we've covered yesterday. We can then make these new elements show up in the page by using the `appendChild()` (old) or `append()` (new) methods on an existing element. We can also use the `insertAdjacentElement()` method to easily add a sibling element similar to how we did using `insertAdjacentText()` yesterday.

If creating individual elements using the above methods becomes too tedious, we can also write HTML elements using strings, and then use the `innerHTML` attribute or `insertAdjacentHTML()` method on an existing element to add the HTML to the page. We can even use template strings to interpolate variables in the HTML string! If for some reason we need to access some DOM node within a HTML string however, we'll need to parse the string first into a DOM fragment using the `document.createRange().createContextualFragment()` method.

HTML strings should be used with caution however, as malicious users may be able to run malicious code if we do not sanitize the user inputs before turning them into these HTML strings. Wes also has a lecture all about security wwhich will explore this topic in-depth later in the course.

We can also traverse through the DOM _elements_ (Actual HTML tags like `<div>`, ignoring text nodes) starting from an already selected element using these (self-explanatory) properties: `children`, `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`,`previousElementSibling`, `nextElementSibling`, and `parentElement`. We also have additional methods to traverse DOM _nodes_ (does NOT ignore text nodes): `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `previousSibling`, `nextSibling`, and `parentNode`.

Wes also introduces us to the **"Cardio"** exercises, which aims to let us practice through this section's material through a series of exercises that are all related to one another. This section's Cardio exercise covers the different DOM properties and methods we've learned starting from yesterday, and walks us through the general workflow for working with the DOM staring from creating an element, adding content/classes/attributes/etc., adding more elements as children/siblings, and creating dynamic HTML content by writing a function that accepts some variables to be interpolated into the HTML string.

### Day 7: June 26, 2022

**What we learned:** Working with event listeners, the `event` object, and event propagation.

**My Notes:** We've seen a preview of this topic on the past lectures and exercises, but today we officially learn about event listeners!

We can add an event listener to an element using the `addEventListener()` method, and passing it the event we want to listen for (`"click"`, `"mousemove"`, etc.) and a **_callback function_**, which is a function that gets called when the user triggers the event.

If we want to listen to events for multiple elements at once (i.e. elements returned by `document.querySelectorAll()`), we'll need to loop over the elements, or use the `forEach()` method to add the event listeners to the individual elements.

Of course, event listeners are nothing without the actual _events_ that we need to deal with! The callback function we passed in `addEventListener` will actually get called with an `event` parameter, which is an object containing several useful details about the actual event being triggered (like the screen coordinates where the user has clicked/moved their mouse on). More importantly, the `event` object also contains the `target` (which element triggered the event?) and `currentTarget` (which element is the event listener attached to?) attributes.

We also learn about **_event propagation_**, where events "bubble" up to the top of the DOM tree and triggers relevant event listeners along the way. We can take advantage of this by adding a third argument to our `addEventListener()` call, passing an object which can have multiple options such as `capture`. Setting `capture: true` lets us fire off the event at the _capture phase_ (going down from the top of the DOM to the actual element that triggered the event) rather than the _bubble phase_ (going from the element that triggered the event to the top of the DOM). If we want to stop the event from bubbling up (or down in the capture phase), we can also add `event.stopPropagation()` within our callback function.

Finally, we get a preview of the `this` keyword. When we inspect `this` within our event listener, we'll see that it (ideally) points to the element that the listener is attached to (similar to `event.currentTarget`). However when we use an arrow function as our callback function, `this` will instead point to the parent scope (like an outer nested function or the `window` object). We'll learn more about `this` in the upcoming sections!
